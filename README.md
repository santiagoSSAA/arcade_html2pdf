# html2pdf

Tools to interact with the html2pdf API. Now Arcade can download webpages as PDFs!

To use this toolkit, you need an API key from [html2pdf.app](https://html2pdf.app/). Once you have your API key, you can either export it as `HTML2PDF_API_KEY` in your environment variables or save it into `arcade.dev` credentials with the same name.

## Creating your new toolkit repo

1. Run `arcade new` and answer all the questions
2. Navigate to your new toolkit directory:
   ```bash
   cd html2pdf
   ```
3. Initialize git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
4. Create a new repository in Github with the same name as your new toolkit
   > Note: Don't create a README, LICENSE or .gitignore when creating the repository because `arcade new` has already created these files for you.
5. Add remote and push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/santiagoSSAA/html2pdf.git
   git branch -M main
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```
